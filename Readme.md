Update: Jul 12th, 2018: Added openCV to redraw the map and simplify the data. In the process of gathering training data.

This is an AI that plays the game Starcraft II. To train the model, run the file training.py using python 3.

(Change difficulty level by replacing "Hard" in <i>Computer(Race.Terran, Difficulty.Hard)</i> with the difficult level you want.)

Note: Change the value of os.environ["SC2PATH"] in the file to your correct Starcraft II folder.
