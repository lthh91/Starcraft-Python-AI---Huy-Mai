Update: Jul 10th, 2018: The bot can now play a full game, but the strategy is still hard coded.

This is an AI that plays the game Starcraft II. Simply install python 3, the package py-sc2 and install Starcraft II to run the bot. Run the file startgame.py using python 3.
(Change difficulty level by replacing "Easy" in <i>Computer(Race.Terran, Difficulty.Easy)</i> with the difficult level you want.)

Note: Please install the game in the default location, or else you may need to change the path.py file in your ec2 package to point to the right folder.
